## Aggregator

This repo is a test for event sourcing using goka and kafka.
Its consuming a websocket stream of bitcoin transactions, writing it to a kafka topic and then aggregates them into a window.

Its a merged and refined version of two of [Mikes](https://github.com/mikedewar) repos:\
- [BTC Dispersion](https://github.com/mikedewar/btcDispersion) \
- [Aggregator](https://github.com/mikedewar/aggregator)
